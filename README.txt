Moodle - the world's open source learning platform

Moodle <https://moodle.org> is a learning platform designed to provide
educators, administrators and learners with a single robust, secure and
integrated system to create personalised learning environments. You can
download Moodle to run it on your own web server, ask one of our Moodle
Partners to assist you at <https://moodle.com>, or have a site set up for you
at <https://moodlecloud.com/>.

Moodle is trusted by institutions and organisations around the world. It has
been adapted for use across education, business, non-profit, government, and
community contexts, both large and small.

Moodle is provided freely as open source software, under the GNU General Public
License. Anyone can adapt, extend or modify Moodle for both commercial and
non-commercial projects without any licensing fees and benefit from the
cost-efficiencies, flexibility and other advantages.

Moodle is written in PHP and Javascript and uses an SQL database for storing
the data. MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL are natively supported.

See <https://docs.moodle.org/> for an overview of features, quick guides and
detailed description of all the provided functionality.
