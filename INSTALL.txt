MOODLE INSTALLATION
===================

If you are an expert and/or in a hurry, please follow the documentation page
<https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installation_quick_guide>.

You don't need to install your own Moodle site. For quick preview of Moodle
features, please check <https://moodle.org/demo>. You can also get fully
working Moodle site for you at <https://moodlecloud.com/>.

For detailed step by step guideline on how to install your own Moodle site,
please follow <https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle> page.

Short summary of the installation process (can take just a few minutes of even
less):

1. Move the Moodle files into your web directory.

2. Create a single database for Moodle to store all its tables in (or choose an
   existing database).

3. Visit your Moodle site with a browser, you should be taken to the
   install.php script, which will lead you through creating a config.php file
   and then setting up Moodle, creating an admin account etc.

4. Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php every minute.

Good luck and have fun!
